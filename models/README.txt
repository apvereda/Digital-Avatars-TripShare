This folder contains the UML models used in the specification of TripShare Application using our approach

* CM-noTrust.use: UML model in USE without Trust management, just the Digital Avatar application
* testCM-noTrust.soil: set of commands for executing the USE model with the application (without incorporating trust)
* CM-noTrust_default.clt: USE class layout file for the CM-noTrust.use model.

* CM.use: UML model in USE of the Trip Share application with our trust model incorporated.
* testCM.soil: set of commands for executing the USE model with the application
* CM_default.clt: USE class layout file for the CM.use model.
* CM-trust-CD.clt: another USE layout file for the CM.use model (another view of the class diagram).
* CM-OD.olt: USE layout file for displaying the object diagram of the application, created by the soil file.
